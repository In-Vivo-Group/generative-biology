# Introduction

Computing technologies have become indispensable to life scientists, changing how research is conducted and expanding the scope of scientific discovery. The history of computing in the life sciences is marked by significant milestones that have advanced research, including early algorithmic approaches to the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Early uses of computers in the 1950s for population genetics calculations and the pioneering work of Alan Turing in biological morphogenesis set the stage for subsequent developments. Over the following decades, computational biology evolved from basic protein structure analysis to complex genomic studies, driven by advancements in DNA sequencing and computing.

Today, the terms AI, ML, deep learning, and large language models (LLMs) are often used interchangeably in the life sciences. Although these terms are related, they each have distinct meanings (Figure 2).  AI broadly refers to machines designed to mimic human intelligence. ML is a subset of AI focused on algorithms that improve through experience. Deep learning is a subset of ML involving neural networks with many layers that can learn from vast amounts of data, and LLMs, such as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models like ChatGPT, are a specific type of deep learning that excel in understanding and generating human-like text. By processing and analyzing biological data at unprecedented scale and speeds, these technologies have advanced fields such as bioinformatics, structural biology, and genomics.
Understanding distinctions among AI-related nomenclature is crucial as technology development accelerates. Decisions about funding, regulation, new product development, and the implementation of new technologies rely on an accurate understanding of what these technologies can and cannot do. A nuanced understanding of the capabilities and limitations of AI, ML, LLMs and other computational tools can help to correctly estimate their potential and effectively utilize valuable resources.

This paper provides an overview of historical context, current applications, and future directions of computing in the life sciences. By explaining key terms, concepts, and timelines, we aim to bridge the knowledge gap between practitioners and stakeholders, fostering an environment for progress that supports scientific innovation and public benefit outcomes.
