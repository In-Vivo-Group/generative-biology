## Sequence Modeling

### Transformer architectures for modeling DNA sequences
The HyenaDNA paper introduces a new genomic foundation model called HyenaDNA that can process DNA sequences at single nucleotide resolution with ultralong context lengths up to 1 million base pairs - a 500x increase over previous transformer models. HyenaDNA uses a parameter-efficient convolutional architecture that allows it to scale subquadratically with sequence length, enabling the use of full genome-scale context. On a range of regulatory genomics prediction tasks, HyenaDNA matches or exceeds the performance of previous state-of-the-art models while using 1500x fewer parameters and 3200x less pretraining data. HyenaDNA also demonstrates the ability to perform challenging species classification using the full mutational profile visible at 1 million base pairs of context. The authors explore new training techniques to enable ultralong sequence modeling as well as prompt-based tuning methods for rapidly adapting to new tasks without updating pre-trained weights @doi:10.48550/arXiv.2306.15794.

## Outlook  

### Challenges in predicting long-range chromatin interactions
The development of transformer architectures like HyenaDNA that can leverage genome-scale context creates new opportunities for understanding long-range chromatin interactions, gene regulation, and intercellular networks. However, significant challenges remain in improving model accuracy and uncertainty quantification. Hybrid physics- and data-driven approaches may help address these gaps. Safety considerations around synthetic genome design also warrant further research to ensure responsible innovation as these generative capabilities advance. Overall, the future looks bright for generative models that can capture both local mutations and global patterns critical to biology @doi:10.48550/arXiv.2306.15794.
