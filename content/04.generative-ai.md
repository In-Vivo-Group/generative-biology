# Recent Advances in Generative AI

## Introduction

Brief background on rise of generative models like GPT-3, DALL-E, AlphaFold, etc. Summary of scope and goals of chapter focused on key advances in last 1-2 years.

## Transformer-Based Language Models

### GPT-3 and Foundation Models

- Overview of GPT-3 architecture and self-supervised training on massive text corpus 
- Discussion of GPT-3 capabilities and limits, including few-shot learning
- Concept of foundation models as basis for many downstream applications

### Other Notable Models

- Summary of other major transformer language models like Google's PaLM, DeepMind's Gopher, Meta's OPT, Anthropic's Claude etc.
- Comparison of model sizes, architectures, training approaches
- Benchmarking of models on various NLP tasks

## Multimodal Generative Models

### DALL-E 2 and Text-to-Image Generation

- Explain DALL-E 2 architecture and training methodology
- Discuss capabilities in text-to-image generation 
- Issues around bias, appropriate use cases

### Other Multimodal Models

- Overview of models like Imagen, Parti, Flamingo for text-to-image
- Discussion of video generation models like Googles Imagen Video
- Models for text to 3D shapes, text to music etc.

## Outlook

- Key challenges and limitations of current generative models
- Likely future advances building on these models
- Broader societal impact of widely available generative models
