# Generative AI and the Biosecurity Landscape

## Introduction

- Background on biosecurity threats from natural, accidental, and intentional pathogens
- Rise of generative AI as a dual use technology for biodefense and misuse 

## Enhanced Risks

- Automated bioweapon design with generative models
- Relatively low computing needs to generate dangerous agents
- Challenges detecting artificially generated sequences/organisms

## Enhanced Response Capabilities

- Generative models for vaccine and therapeutic design
- High-throughput testing of countermeasures with synthetic data
- AI for early detection of emergent pathogens and outbreaks

## Recommendations

- Increased oversight for generative model development/release
- Expanding biosecurity legislation and regulations 
- Fostering open research and global cooperation  

## Outlook

- Trajectory toward increasingly powerful generative biological capabilities  
- Need for preventative ethics research and guidance
- Maintaining public trust and avoiding overreaction 

## Conclusion

- Balancing generative AI's benefits and risks in biology
- Importance of thoughtful governance and responsible innovation
- Staying ahead of the curve on biosecurity
