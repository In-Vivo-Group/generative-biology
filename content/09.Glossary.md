# Glossary

- **Algorithm:** A step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem, often used in computer programming and computational biology.

- **AlphaFold:** An AI program developed by DeepMind that predicts protein structures with high accuracy.

- **Autoencoders:** A type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient codings of unlabeled data.

- **Bioinformatics:** The application of computer technology to the management and analysis of biological data.

- **Computational Biology:** A field that uses mathematical models, algorithms, and computational techniques to understand and analyze biological systems.

- **CRISPR:** A technology used for editing genomes, allowing researchers to alter DNA sequences and modify gene function.

- **Deep Learning:** A subset of machine learning involving neural networks with many layers.

- **DNA Sequencing:** The process of determining the nucleic acid sequence â€“ the order of nucleotides in DNA.

- **Fourier Analysis:** A mathematical technique used to transform signals between time (or spatial) domain and frequency domain, applied in protein crystallography to determine structures.

- **Fixed-size vector representation:** A numerical representation of a fixed length that encapsulates the information or features extracted from a variable-length input. In machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), fixed-size vector representations are commonly used to represent textual or sequential data.

- **Genome:** The complete set of genes or genetic material present in a cell or organism.

- **Genomics:** The study of genomes, the complete set of DNA within an organism, including its structure, function, evolution, and mapping.

- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** A class of machine learning systems where two neural networks contest with each other in a game.

- **Machine Learning (ML):** A subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the development of algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions based on data.

- **Maximum Likelihood Methods:** Statistical methods for estimating the parameters of a model, used in phylogenetic inference to determine the most likely tree structure.

- **Metagenomics:** The study of genetic material recovered directly from environmental samples.

- **Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA):** A method used to align three or more biological sequences to identify regions of similarity that may indicate functional, structural, or evolutionary relationships.

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** The ability of a computer program to understand human language as it is spoken.

- **Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm:** An algorithm used for pairwise sequence alignment that employs dynamic programming to find the optimal alignment between two sequences.

- **Neural Networks:** A series of algorithms that mimic the operations of a human brain to recognize relationships between vast amounts of data.

- **Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS):** High-throughput sequencing technologies that allow for rapid sequencing of DNA or RNA samples.

- **PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction):** A method widely used in molecular biology to make several copies of a specific DNA segment.

- **Phylogenetics:** The study of the evolutionary history and relationships among individuals or groups of organisms.

- **Proteomics:** The large-scale study of proteins, particularly their structures and functions.

- **Reinforcement Learning:** A type of machine learning where an agent learns to behave in an environment by performing actions and seeing the results.

- **Systems Biology:** An approach in biomedical research to understanding the larger picture by putting its pieces together (holism instead of reductionism).

- **Transcriptomics:** The study of the complete set of RNA transcripts produced by the genome.

- **Unsupervised Learning:** A type of machine learning that looks for previously undetected patterns in a data set with no pre-existing labels.
